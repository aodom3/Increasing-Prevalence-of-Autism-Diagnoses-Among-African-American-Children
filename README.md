The goal is to examine whether diagnosis rates have increased and how those trends compare across racial and ethnic groups.

The analysis focuses on diagnostic prevalence and highlights how improvements in screening, awareness, and access to care may influence observed trends.

## Objectives

Analyze changes in autism diagnosis prevalence among African American children over time
Compare trends across racial and ethnic groups
Visualize disparities and convergence in diagnostic patterns
Present insights using clear, stakeholder-friendly Power BI dashboards
